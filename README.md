## Use case
* **Collaborative media library:** let family or friends adding Movies or TV Shows to your Synology easily with this web app. If you use direct download hosts like Uptobox or Mega, thanks to Synology Download Station Hosts you can let your NAS debrid the download link using your Premium account (for 1fichier.com, Uptobox and Uplea you need to install a custom Download Station host that you can [find here](https://github.com/warkx/Synology-DownloadStation-Hosts)). Then use a Media Server like [PLEX](https://www.plex.tv) or [Kodi](https://kodi.tv) to make it available for all and on any device.
* Another use case? Tell me!
